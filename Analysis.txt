In this report, we looked at the math and reading scores in the district, compared by school size, per student budget, and charter status.

The most stark differences were in the size of the school and whether or not it was a charter school. Schools with 2000 students or fewer had much higher passing rates in both reading and math. Overall, approximately 90% of students in Small or Medium sized schools were passing both reading and math, compared to only 58% in large schools. Similarly, charter schools had an overall passing rate of 90%, compared to district schools at 54%.
